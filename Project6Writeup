Digital Ocean:
We used Digital Ocean to host our web application. In order to do this, we needed to create a droplet on Digital Ocean.The droplet is named "Free-And-For-Sale". The machine is of type "2 GB Memory / 30 GB Disk / NYC3 - Ubuntu 16.04.1 x64".
In order to get the web app up and running, we first installed docker on the droplet using guidelines from Project 0. Then, the database was set up as specified in Project 1. After setting up the database, the project was cloned and docker-compose was run. The site is now available at http://104.131.179.218:8000/fafs/
