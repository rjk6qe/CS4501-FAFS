Digital Ocean:
We used Digital Ocean to host our web application. In order to do this, we needed to create a droplet on Digital Ocean.The droplet is named "Free-And-For-Sale". The machine is of type "2 GB Memory / 30 GB Disk / NYC3 - Ubuntu 16.04.1 x64".
In order to get the web app up and running, we first installed docker on the droplet using guidelines from Project 0. Then, the database was set up as specified in Project 1. After setting up the database, the project was cloned and docker-compose was run. The site is now available at http://104.131.179.218:8000/fafs/

Redis:
In the experience layer, redis was used to cache requests that pertain to operations where you GET a user, category, or product.
These can been seen in the views.py file for the EXP layer from line 44 - 77. If a POST operation was perform, this would modify the data, therefore the cache is then flushed.
The cache is also set to expire within one hour.


Continuous Integration (Travis CI):
